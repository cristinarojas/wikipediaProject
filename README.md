# Wikipedia App
This project was built with HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla Javascript and Nodejs.
- [x] Note: I took the decision to use Nodejs because I got some CORS error when I was working with Wikipedia API.

This App reads the Wikipedia API and display the results to the user.

## To run this Wikipedia App
1. You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Clone the repository in your terminal [wikipediaProject](https://github.com/cristinarojas/wikipediaProject):

```
git clone git@github.com:cristinarojas/wikipediaProject.git
```

3. Then open the project directory in your terminal:
9
```
cd wikipediaProject
```

4. Run this command in the terminal to install the NPM dependencies:

```
npm install
```

5. To run the Wikipedia App execute this command in the terminal:

```
npm start
```

6. Finally open your browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the App running.
